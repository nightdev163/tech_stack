container:
	Simply put, a container is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine.


container image:
	This custom filesystem is provided by a container image.Since the image contains the containerâ€™s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc.
