RDD Transformations
RDD transformations returns pointer to new RDD and allows you to create dependencies between RDDs. Each RDD in dependency chain (String of Dependencies) has a function for calculating its data and has a pointer (dependency) to its parent RDD.  
Therefore, RDD transformation is not a set of data but is a step in a program (might be the only step) telling Spark how to get data and what to do with it.
