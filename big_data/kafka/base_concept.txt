KAFKA CONNECT
	Kafka Connect is a tool for scalably and reliably streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems.


boot standalone connect
	bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties connector1.properties [connector2.properties ...]


	worker configuration config/connect-standalone.properties
		bootstrap.servers - List of Kafka servers used to bootstrap connections to Kafka
		key.converter - Converter class used to convert between [Kafka Connect format] and the [serialized form that is written to Kafka].
		value.converter - Converter class used to convert between Kafka [Connect format] and the [serialized form that is written to Kafka]. 	
		offset.storage.file.filename - File to store offset data in

	connector configuration
		Connector configurations are simple key-value mappings.		
		standalone mode:
			are defined in a properties file and passed to the Connect process on the command line
		distributed mode:
			they will be included in the JSON payload for the request that creates (or modifies) the connector.


boot distributed connect
	bin/connect-distributed.sh config/connect-distributed.properties


Transformations
	Connectors can be configured with transformations to make lightweight message-at-a-time modifications. They can be convenient for data massaging and event routing.
